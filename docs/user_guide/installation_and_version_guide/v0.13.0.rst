Other improvements
------------------
* Vectorized the curve interpolation step in :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` to improve performance and readability: :pr:`1448` by :user:`Tahar Allouche <taharallouche>`.
* Allowed multi-dimensional input data :code:`X` (:code:`ndims > 2`) in :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` and :code:`ExponentiatedGradient`: :pr:`1470` by :user:`Tahar Allouche <taharallouche>`.
* Removed support for python 3.8 and added support for python 3.12: :pr:`1488` by :user:`Tamara Atanasoska <tamaraatanasoska>`.
* :class:`reductions.ErrorRate` now supports inputs (TODO: list all) from pandas, polars or pyarrow dataframe libraries (either one of these); the outputs are provided from the same namespace as the inputs for polars and pyarrow or as pandas types (for numpy and pandas inputs) to keep backwards compatibility: :pr:`1526` by :user:`Stefanie Senger <StefanieSenger>`.
